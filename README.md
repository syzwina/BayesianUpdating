# BayesianUpdating

A program that automates the Bayes' Theorem, or more known as Bayesian Updating.

---

Bayesian Updating is a method used to update a probability table whenever new information is obtained.

In the file BayesianUpdating.c, an event where there are 3 socks in a basket occurs.
We do not know how many red or black socks are in the basket. 
Through user-input, the program will update the probability of having i amount of red socks in the basket.

In order for this program to produce 'elegant' outputs, you'll have to use a ANSI terminal. If you are on a windows, the [cmder](https://cmder.net/) command line is a ANSI terminal.
